Hello, my name is Jesus and I've recently enrolled into the Coding Dojo 20-Week bootcamp. I will be learning three different stacks in order to prepare myself for the field of Web Development. I also have an interest in embedded systems and experiment with the arduino microcontroller and raspberry pi. I look forward to learning everything I can and applying it to Web Development, I also can't wait to see how technology will change and grow. Just to throw a bit of a curveball in this intro one of my favorite movies is Predator, the original with Arnold!
